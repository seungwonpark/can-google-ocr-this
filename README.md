# can-google-ocr-this

## Motivation

Looks like Google is possible to recognize characters in arbitrary images/videos, and show them on search results.

Here, I aim to check whether certain keywords can be recognized from Google.
I'll try to produce hard examples as possible.

## Examples

ASCII Art -- this is not suitable for "Optical" Character Recognition, however, perhaps some day LMs might be able to recognize this!
